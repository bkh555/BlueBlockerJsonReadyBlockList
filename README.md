# BlueBlockerJsonReadyBlockList
A collection of JSON files to import to the Blue Blocker extension for Twitter / X

https://github.com/kheina-com/Blue-Blocker

The snapshot of users is from around June 2023. Try to only import one list at a time, until your block list clears, since the more blocks you have queued the slower Twitter will be.
Click on the extension button, "view" next to the queue number, then the import dropdown, and then drag or select your file.
Files are sorted by newest, will add more over time.
